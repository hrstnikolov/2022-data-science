    "Machines and equipment must be periodically inspected and serviced. Parts are replaced and consumables are replenished. One strategy is to repair the equipment only after a break down occurs; this is called **corrective / reactive maintenance**. If, on the other hand, this maintenance is done in a scheduled points in time (say every month) we call it **preventive / scheduled maintenance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both strategies have drawbacks (e.g. over-maintenance: equipment gets maintained whether it needs it or not). A more scientific alternative is to determine the condition of the machine and forecast the time left till the next failure; this is called **predictive maintenance**. Good definition is given by [pwc](https://www.pwc.de/de/digitale-transformation/digital-factories-2020-shaping-the-future-of-manufacturing.pdf):\n",
